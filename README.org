Simple Emacs functions calling uncrustify on a buffer or region.

To automatically uncrustify the code when saving the file add something
like the following in your configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
          '(lambda()
             (make-local-variable 'write-contents-hooks)
             (add-hook 'write-contents-hooks 'uncrustify)))
#+END_SRC
